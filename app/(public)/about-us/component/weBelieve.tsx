        <p>Learning is the source of human progress.</p>

        <p>
          It has the power to transform our world<br />
          from illness to health,<br />
          from poverty to prosperity,<br />
          from conflict to peace.
        </p>

        <p>
          It has the power to transform our lives<br />
          for ourselves,<br />
          for our families,<br />
          for our communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          No matter who we are or where we are,<br />
          learning empowers us to change and grow<br />
          and redefine what&apos;s possible.<br />
          That&apos;s why access to the best learning is a right, not a privilege.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that&apos;s why Coursera is here.<br />
          We partner with the best institutions<br />
          to bring the best learning<br />
          to every corner of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          So that anyone, anywhere has the power to<br />
          transform their lives through learning.
